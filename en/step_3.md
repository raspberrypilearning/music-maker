Your instrument will play notes when another sprite touches different colours on your instrument sprite. This is similar to how a guitar will play notes when a pick touches the strings, or a piano plays notes when fingers press on the keys.

--- task ---

Make or choose a sprite that will follow your mouse pointer and be used to play different notes. In the example below, we have used a simple coloured circle.

--- /task ---

Now, get your sprite to follow your mouse pointer, so that the person playing the instrument can control it.

--- task ---

Add code so that your new sprite follows the mouse pointer.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
go to (mouse-pointer v)
```
--- /task ---

Use `My Blocks`{:class='block3myblocks'} to design what your instrument sounds like.

<p style='border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;'>Scratch uses what are called **midi** values to set the pitch of any note that is played. A **midi** value of `60` is the same as **middle C**. The higher the **midi** value, the higher the pitch of the note.
</p>

--- task ---

There are many elements of music that you can experiment with. You can change the notes, instrument, beats, rest, and tempo.

Create a `My Blocks`{:class='block3myblocks'} block that has inputs for as many of these elements as you want.

play note (note) for (beats) beats
rest for (rest) beats

When the sprite that is following the mouse pointer, touches a specific colour on your **instrument** a sound should be played. Your music maker can use the `play note`{:class='block3myblocks'} block to set different instruments, notes, beats and rests.

--- task ---

 Add `if...then`{:class='block3control'} blocks and the `play note:`{:class='block3myblocks'} blocks to your instrument sprite. Add as many `if...else`{:class='block3control'} blocks as you need.

end
if <touching color (#7f20c0) > then 
play note: (62) beats (0.25) rest (0.25)::custom
end
end

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

title: My instrument does not play anything when my sprite touches it
---

Did you use the **color picker** to select the colour that played a note, on your `touching color`{:class='block3sensing'} blocks?

Add as many different colours as you want notes. Sometimes when you have very similar shades of colour, it may recognize it as the same colour (and therefore note).

title: The music plays too quickly or too slow

You can change the length of time that a note plays for, and for the time between notes. In your `play note:`{:class='block3myblocks'} block adjust the `beats`{:class='block3myblocks'} and `rest`{:class='block3myblocks'} values. Increase them to slow down the music, and decrease them to speed it up.

You can change the length of time that a note plays for, and for the time between notes. In your `play note:`{:class='block3myblocks'} block adjust the `beats`{:class='block3myblocks'} and `rest`{:class='block3myblocks'} values. Increase them to slow down the music, and decrease them to speed it up.
