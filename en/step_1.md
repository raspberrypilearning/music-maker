</p>

<mark>think about how to incorporate the experience of being deaf or hard of hearing into this project. music vibrations can be felt.. think of something around that to surface. Try not to use the word 'hear' if speaking generally </mark>

You will:
+ Design your own virtual musical instrument
+ Customise the User Interaction with the music
+ Explore the relationship between maths and music
