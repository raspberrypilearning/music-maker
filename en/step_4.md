The great thing about digital music is that you can get one sprite to easily play the sounds of many different instruments.

Add some sprites to represent the different sounds you want your instrument to play. You can use instrument sprites, or choose whatever you like, it does not have to make sense.

Create a variable called `instrument`{:class='block3variable'}
