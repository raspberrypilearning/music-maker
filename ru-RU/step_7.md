## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project.

You have an awesome instrument and soundscape â€” you can add other layers to the music to make a band, an accompaniment, or add some beats.

Here are some ideas you could try:
- Add other instruments
- Add some beats
- Create a band or choir

You used colour to play notes in this project. Can you think of other ways you can play notes in Scratch?

Here are some ideas:
- Play notes depending on where on the Stage the mouse-pointer is
- Play notes through key presses
- Introduce 'random' to procedurally generate music
- Make a 'copy the tune' game where Scratch plays a tune for the user to copy using the instrument

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a **See inside** link for you to open the project in Scratch and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.

Take a look at our [Music maker Scratch studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30122192){:target="_blank"} to see projects created by community members.
